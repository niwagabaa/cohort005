<h1>CSS INTRO PAGE</h1>

<p class="green_one">Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. 
    
<p class="green_one" id="secondp">The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century</p> 
    
<p class="orange_one">who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for
     use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:

    “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut 
    labore et dolore magna aliqua.”
    The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. 
    A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.</p>
    
<p class="green_one">The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop 
    publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs.
